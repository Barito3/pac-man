# Pac-Man Game

A modern implementation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive Pac-Man movement using arrow keys
- Realistic ghost AI with different behaviors:
  - **Blinky (Red)**: Directly chases Pac-Man
  - **Pinky (Pink)**: Targets a position 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man
  - **Inky (Cyan)**: Uses Blinky's position to set up ambushes
  - **Clyde (Orange)**: Alternates between chasing and retreating
- Ghosts switch between chase, scatter, and frightened modes
- Power pellets that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
